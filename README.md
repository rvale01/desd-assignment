# Assignment app

This is the repo which contains the code for the desd assignment.
In the repo there id:
- sql dump, which is loaded by the dockerfile to be used as a starting point (this contains hardcoded films and showings, and some accounts, however there is the possibility to register a new account too)

- all the scripts needed to run docker (Dockerfile, requirements.txt, wait-for, django-app-entrypoint, docker-compose.yml). 
  The wait-for file was given to us during the tutorials/lectures.
  The Dockerfile, django-app-entrypoint, docker-compose.yml have been written by me taking as a starting points the ones given during the lectures/tutorials
  The requirements.txt was generated using pipenv

- The two django applications: app and customer.

# App
For the assignment, I have choosen the 'customer' user type. The list of requirements is in the appendix of the report.
The docker app contains two applications: the main app and the customer app.
The main app contains all the logic of the login/registration and views to handle them. Also, there is a base.css which is used by the customer application as well.

The templates in the main app are for the 404 page, the homepage, the login and the registration.
In the settings.py file, there are all the configurations needed to run the app smoothly. This file (like most of the other files) is generated by Django when creating the project, but after it was edited and updated with the configs needed for the project. 
Some of the edits done are:
- added the customer app to the list of INSTALLED_APPS
- added TEMPLATES, which contains the directory where to find all the templates
- updated DATABASES with the details to initialised in the Docker yml file.
- added all the configs to use the static files
- added the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL and LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL

In the urls.py file, a few urls were added, one for the accounts, which uses the auth functions provided by Django, the registration/customer which uses a view created by me, the homepage, and the customer url which includes all the urls of the customer application.


# Customer
The customer app contains templates, static files, views, urls, forms and models. The models were used to create the database.
The views are grouped in three different folders: booking, payment, and tickets. All the views require the user to be logged in
The templates used all extend the base.html template in the same folder.
The static files are specific for each template which uses them. Also, each template extends the base.css file which can be found in the app/static folder.
The urls grouped based on each view.
